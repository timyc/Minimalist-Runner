# Minimalist Runner

Made this a couple months back while experimenting with Phaser. Code is extremely messy because I couldn't get Phaser to be responsive so I ended up changing game dimensions with if/else statements based on screen resolution.

The code is pretty bloated and bad, but you can still compile it with Cordova or something and install it on your phone for 15 seconds of entertainment.

The game features:

- A loading screen
- Game Menu
- Game scene itself
- Death/Game Over screen
- Free-to-use YouTube music
- Low-quality art
